This theory suggests that the expansion of the universe will eventually slow down and reverse due to the gravitational pull of all the matter within it.  As the universe collapses, galaxies and eventually all structures will be drawn closer together, culminating in a singularity similar to the Big Bang but in reverse. \n",

This contradicts the notion of a slowing down and eventual reversal of the expansion.  Additionally, the theory doesn't offer a clear explanation for what might happen at the singularity or how the universe might bounce back from it, if at all.\n",
